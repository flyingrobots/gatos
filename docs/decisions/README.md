# GATOS Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the GATOS project. An ADR is a short document that captures a key architectural decision, its context, and its consequences.

The goal of this log is to provide a clear, traceable history of significant design choices, making it easier for current and future contributors to understand the "why" behind the project's structure.

## Decision Status

Each ADR will have a status, typically one of the following:

- **Proposed:** A decision that is under consideration.
- **Accepted:** A decision that has been agreed upon and is being implemented.
- **Superseded:** A decision that was previously accepted but has since been replaced by another decision.
- **Rejected:** A decision that was proposed but not accepted.
