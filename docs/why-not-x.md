# Why Not X?

Short answers to common comparisons.

- Blockchains: Global consensus is expensive and unnecessary for most workflows. GATOS uses Git + signatures with local policy enforcement and verifiable proofs (PoF/PoE/PoX).
- IPFS: Great for content addressing, not a policy-governed operating surface with histories, policies, and computation in one DAG.
- CRDTs: Useful for collaborative edits; GATOS focuses on audited, governed state and deterministic folds with proofs.
- Nix: Deterministic builds, different domain. GATOS governs data, policies, and jobs with append-only history.
- Event Sourcing: GATOS is event sourcing with cryptographic lineage, governance, and deterministic fold proofs baked in.
