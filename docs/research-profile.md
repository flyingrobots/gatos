These are sensible, proof-first defaults for scientific and high-assurance setups. They trade a bit of flexibility for verifiability and reproducibility.

- Proof-of-Fold required on state updates
  - Every state checkpoint must accompany or reference a verifiable fold over an admitted ledger window.

- Fast-forward only namespaces
  - `refs/gatos/policies/**`, `refs/gatos/state/**`, `refs/gatos/audit/**` are FF-only.
  - Enforced by repo policy; violations are denied and logged to audit.

- Message Plane QoS and retention
  - Topics under `refs/gatos/messages/<topic>/head` (and optional shard refs) rotate at \~100k messages or \~192 MB per shard.
  - TTL ≈ 30 days (configurable per topic). Delivery is at-least-once; consumers dedupe by ULID and persist checkpoints under `refs/gatos/consumers/<group>/<topic>`.

- Audit anchors and GC
  - Audit proofs and the latest state checkpoints act as retention anchors for Git GC.
  - Older ephemeral data may be pruned as long as proofs and checkpoints remain.

- Opaque pointers and privacy
  - Public commitments are recorded in history; private bytes live behind a policy-gated resolver.
  - Pointers follow the ADR-0004 schema (`kind/algo/digest/size/location/capability`) with bucketed sizes and digest = `blake3(plaintext)`.
  - Policies may require zero-knowledge proofs, redacted attestations, or external KMS checks.

Adjust these with your IRB/compliance requirements; treat them as a starting point for a verifiable research workflow.

## Enabling the Research Profile

Create `gatos/config/profile.yaml` with:

```yaml
profile: research
```

Then restart `gatosd` (or re-run your commands). Gates will enforce the stricter invariants described above (PoF required on state pushes; FF-only refs; Message Plane rotation/TTL; pointer privacy buckets; audit anchors).
