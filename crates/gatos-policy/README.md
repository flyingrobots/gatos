# GATOS Policy Engine

This crate provides the compiled rule interpreter for GATOS. It is responsible for parsing, compiling, and executing GATOS policy files (`.rgs`) in a pure, deterministic manner to allow or deny actions within the system.

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
