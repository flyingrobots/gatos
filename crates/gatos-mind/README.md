# GATOS Mind (Message Bus)

This crate implements the GATOS Message Bus (`gmb`), an asynchronous, commit-backed pub/sub system. It handles topics, sharding, and different Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for distributed communication between GATOS components.

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
