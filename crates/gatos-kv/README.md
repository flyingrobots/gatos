# GATOS KV (State Cache)

This crate provides a Git-backed state cache. It is used to create and manage materialized views and indexes on top of the GATOS ledger, providing efficient read access to computed state.

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
