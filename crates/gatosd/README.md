# GATOS Daemon and CLI

This crate is the main entry point for the GATOS system. It provides both the `gatosd` daemon, which runs as a server and exposes a JSONL RPC API, and the command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a GATOS repository.

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
