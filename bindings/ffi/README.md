# GATOS FFI Bindings

This crate provides a C-compatible Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for the GATOS core libraries. This allows GATOS to be integrated with other programming languages that can call into a C ABI (e.g., Python, Go, Ruby, etc.).

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
