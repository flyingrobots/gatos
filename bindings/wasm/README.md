# GATOS WASM Bindings

This crate provides WebAssembly bindings for the GATOS core libraries, allowing them to be used in JavaScript environments (like a web browser or Node.js). It uses `wasm-bindgen` to generate the necessary JS-Rust interop code.

For more details on the overall architecture, see the main [GATOS Technical Specification](../../../docs/TECH-SPEC.md).
