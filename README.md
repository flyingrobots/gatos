One part "operating surface".  
One part Git.    
What else is there to say?    
I mean, haha, c'mon, right?.    
The name is _pretty_ descriptive.  

> _"Oh, GATOS? Yes, I've heard that it's like an operating surface and that it's Git. That's right."_

YoU dOnT kNoW wHaT gAtOs Is?! OmG!

Y'all got that "Git-OS" thang?
_It's GATOS!_

**GATOS. It's the Surface that Operates within Git.**

I _git_ it now!

_That's not just any surface! Why, that's an **operating surface**, that's also Git. Neat!_

... You see? That's why they call it "GATOS"...

**Finally.** The operating surface that's _Git_.

---

- **Deterministic**
- **Git-native** operating surface for
- **distributed programs**,
- **policies**, and
- **proofs.**

These are just _some_ of the buzzwords that people have been using to describe what computer scientists are calling "GATOS", Git As The Operating Surface.

"Well, they said it couldn't be done. So, here we are, doing it. And having fun, too!" - flyingrobots, inventor of GATOS.

Imagine, if you will, a world in which computers shared a zero proof, distributed, deterministic, state space. Every ref in the Git repo is a process, and every commit represents a snapshot of that state in time. Policies are code, and woven into the very fabric of the repository's history. Immutable, append-only, cryptographically-signed, state. Offline-first, mergeable, forkable time-traveling, programmable privacy policies, bit-for-bit determinism, distributed general purpose computing.

What if computers shared a public, zero-proof, distributed, deterministic, state space?  
What if every ref in the Git repo was a process, and every commit represented a snapshot of its state in time?  
What if policy was code, and it was woven into the very fabric of the repository's history? 
What if it was **immutable**, **append-only**, **cryptographically-signed**, state? 
**Offline-first**, **mergeable**, **forkable**, **time-travel-able**?
What if privacy was **programmable**?
What if it was **bit-for-bit** deterministic? 

What if there was such a thing as secure, public, distributed, general purpose computing?
Without a blockchain?

That's the power of the gods.
That's the power of forever.
**That's** the power of **GATOS**.
